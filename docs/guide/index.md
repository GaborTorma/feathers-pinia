# Introduction

[[toc]]

Welcome to the apex of Vue Data Modeling and FeathersJS connectivity for the artisan developer. Feathers-Pinia is
**the** first-class data modeling solution built with for Vue Composition API. It is well known for its features which
maximize perceived application speed for end users while providing a pleasant developer experience.

## Overview of Features

- Implicit, Functional Data Modeling maintains your data structure, requires no setup, and is
fully customizable.
- **[Clone and Commit](/guide/common-patterns#mutation-multiplicity-pattern)** dramatically reduces the need for custom
Pinia actions.
- **[Per-Record Defaults](/guide/common-patterns#useinstancedefaults)** offer a functional way of adding default
values and methods to every record.
- **Realtime by Default**: It's ready for WebSocket-enhanced, multi-user interactivity.
- **Independent Reactivity**: no need to assign records to component or store `data` to enable reactive binding.
- **[Local Queries](/data-stores/querying-data)**: Make requests against locally-cached data as though it was a FeathersJS
database, **now with support for SQL `$like` operators.**
- **[Live Queries](/guide/common-patterns.html#reactive-lists-with-live-queries)** with client-side pagination allow
arrays of data to automatically update as new records are added, modified, or removed.
- **[Server-Side Pagination](/services/use-find#server-paging-auto-fetch)**: alternative to live-list pagination,
optionally give all control to the server and perform manual fetching. In this mode, lists only update when new queries
are made.
- **[Super-Efficient SSR](/guide/whats-new#super-efficient-ssr)**: optimize server-loaded data on the client without
refetching. The latest Nuxt APIs are fully supported.
- **[Fall-Through Cache](/services/use-find)** like SWR but with built-in, low-memory query intelligence. It knows which
records can be shared between different queries, which allows relevant records to show immediately while additional data
is fetched.
- Flexible code patterns allow developers to work as they wish.
  - **Active Record Pattern**: allows use of utility methods built on each instance. This pattern allows creation of
  loosely-coupled components built around the instance interface.
  - **Data Mapper Pattern**: allows you to use a store-centric workflow where you let store logic perform operations
  on your data.
- **[Flexible Auth Support](/guide/use-auth)** with the new `useAuth` composition utility.
API.
- Full support for [FeathersJS v5 Dove](https://feathersjs.com) and earlier versions of Feathers.

## Coming from Feathers-Vuex

Feathers-Pinia is the next generation of [Feathers-Vuex](https://vuex.feathersjs.com). The difference is that it's built on [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/): a Vue store with an intuitive API.

Using Pinia in your apps will have a few positive effects:

- The clean API requires lower mental overhead to use.
  - No more weird Vuex syntax.
  - No more mutations; just actions.
  - Use Composable Stores instead of injected rootState, rootGetters, etc.
- Lower mental overhead means developers spend more time in a creative space. This usually results in an increase of productivity.
- You'll have smaller bundle sizes. Not only is Pinia tiny, it's also modular. You don't have to register all of the plugins in a central store. Pinia's architecture enables tree shaking, so only the services needed for the current view need to load.

See the Migration Guide for developers [coming from Feathers-Vuex](/migrate/from-feathers-vuex).
